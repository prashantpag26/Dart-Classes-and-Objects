Let's dive into Dart classes and objects in simple terms.

### Classes in Dart

In Dart, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes or variables) and behaviors (methods or functions) that objects of the class will have. Here's a basic example of a class:

```dart
// Define a class named Person
class Person {
  // Properties (variables)
  String name;
  int age;

  // Constructor
  Person(this.name, this.age);

  // Method
  void sayHello() {
    print('Hello, my name is $name and I am $age years old.');
  }
}
```

In this example:
- **Class Declaration (`class Person`)**: Defines a class named `Person`.
- **Properties (`String name; int age;`)**: These are variables that store data about each object created from the class.
- **Constructor (`Person(this.name, this.age);`)**: This special method initializes new objects when they are created. It's used to set initial values for `name` and `age`.
- **Method (`void sayHello() { ... }`)**: Functions inside a class are called methods. They define the behavior of the objects created from the class.

### Objects in Dart

An object is an instance of a class. You create objects to use the properties and methods defined in the class. Hereâ€™s how you create objects and use them:

```dart
void main() {
  // Create an object of class Person
  var person1 = Person('Alice', 30);

  // Access object properties
  print(person1.name); // Output: Alice
  print(person1.age);  // Output: 30

  // Call object methods
  person1.sayHello();  // Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
}
```

In this code:
- **Creating Objects (`var person1 = Person('Alice', 30);`)**: This line creates a new instance of the `Person` class with the name `Alice` and age `30`.
- **Accessing Properties (`person1.name`, `person1.age`)**: These lines access the `name` and `age` properties of the `person1` object.
- **Calling Methods (`person1.sayHello();`)**: This line calls the `sayHello` method on the `person1` object, which prints a greeting with the person's name and age.

### In Short

- **Classes** are blueprints for creating objects, defining their properties and behaviors.
- **Objects** are instances of classes, allowing you to work with the data and behaviors defined in the class.
